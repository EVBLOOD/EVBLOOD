Hi, I’m Saad.

I design and build software systems. Sometimes from the ground up, sometimes by stepping into existing ones and making sense of them.

My work spans backend, frontend, and infrastructure, but I don’t define myself by a stack. What I rely on most is my ability to adapt quickly, understand unfamiliar systems, and make solid technical decisions under real constraints.

I’ve built full-stack applications, real-time systems, and long-running projects where correctness, state, and maintainability actually matter. I’m comfortable owning a system end-to-end — from early architecture decisions to debugging production issues.

### What I work on
- Backend and API design
- Full-stack web applications
- Real-time and event-driven systems
- System design, refactoring, and cleanup
- Projects that require fast context-switching and ownership

### How I work
- Understand the problem and constraints before choosing tools
- Build a clear mental model of the system
- Prefer simple, explainable solutions over clever ones
- Optimize for stability and long-term clarity

### Work context
- Freelance & contract work (new builds and takeover projects)
- Remote-friendly
- Comfortable working independently or inside existing teams

You’ll find here:
- Full-stack applications
- Real-time and multiplayer projects
- Systems-oriented work from my 42 background
- Experiments and long-running codebases
